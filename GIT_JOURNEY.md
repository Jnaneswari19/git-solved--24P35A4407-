\## ðŸ§  Task Summary

Cloned the instructorâ€™s repository with pre-built merge conflicts and resolved all issues across multiple branches using advanced Git workflows.



---



\## ðŸªœ Steps Completed



\### Phase 1: Setup

\- Cloned the instructor repository.  

\- Configured Git user identity.  

\- Explored repository history using `git log --oneline --graph --all`.



\### Phase 2: First Merge (main + dev)

\- Performed `git merge dev` and handled multiple file conflicts.

\- Resolved conflicts in:  

&nbsp; - `README.md`  

&nbsp; - `config/app-config.yaml`  

&nbsp; - `config/database-config.json`  

&nbsp; - `docs/architecture.md`  

&nbsp; - `scripts/deploy.sh`  

&nbsp; - `scripts/monitor.js`

\- Successfully committed the merged result.



\### Phase 3: Second Merge (main + conflict-simulator)

\- Merged and resolved additional complex conflicts.  

\- Practiced conflict resolution with multiple file edits and commits.



\### Phase 4: Git Commands Practice

\- \*\*Used `git fetch`\*\* 1 time to check updates from instructor.  

\- \*\*Used `git pull`\*\* 1 time to sync local main branch.  

\- \*\*Used `git stash`\*\* 1 time for temporary work storage.  

\- \*\*Used `git cherry-pick`\*\* 1 time to copy a commit from feature branch to main.  

\- \*\*Used `git rebase`\*\* 1 time to align branches with main.  

\- \*\*Used `git reset`\*\* 3 times (soft, mixed, hard).  

\- \*\*Used `git revert`\*\* 1 time to undo a bad commit safely.  

\- \*\*Used `git tag`\*\* 2 times to mark releases (v1.0.0 and v1.1.0).  



\### Phase 5: Documentation

\- Created `CHANGELOG.md` to record all Git command usages.

\- Created `GIT\_JOURNEY.md` (this file) to summarize the challenge.

\## âœ… Outcome

Successfully completed all Git mastery tasks, resolved merge conflicts, and demonstrated understanding of advanced Git commands including stash, rebase, cherry-pick, reset, revert, and tagging.



---



\*\*Final Repository Status:\*\*  

All conflicts resolved, all commits pushed, and tags created (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`).
